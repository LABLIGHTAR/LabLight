    "description": "This protocol details a step-by-step procedure for determining PON1 activity in plasma or serum using phenyl acetate substrate. The method employs kinetic measurements using a UV-transparent 96-well microplate with readings at 270 nm, and activity rates are converted via the Beer–Lambert law after pathlength correction. This protocol includes detailed calibration measures, safety considerations, storage and stability instructions, and failure prevention strategies.",
